# ecommerce-app
Creation of a serverless ecommerce application on cloud using AWS services. 
The application consists of a static and dynamic section. 
The static part includes our HTML/CSS/JavaScript files which will be served using Amazon CloudFront and stored in Amazon S3. 
The dynamic part involves the functionality of our application including features like searching for products, adding/removing items from the cart and login/register into the application. This will be done using Amazon API Gateway, AWS Lambda, Amazon OpenSearch Service and Amazon DynamoDB. The security and identity services used are AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) and Amazon Cognito.
